### Final Project for RevoU FSSE Amsterdam

## About

![Harvesthub Logo](front-end\public\images\logoharvest.png)

Harvesthub is an e-commerce web application focusing on connecting local farmers and consumers to easily conduct business transactions. Local farmers can receive earnings directly without the use of costly third part distributors, while consumers can receive fresh local products straight from the farm!

Our current features include :

1. The ability for sellers or buyers to register and sign in.
2. The ability for sellers to create, update, and delete their products to be sold.
3. The ability for buyers to browse product page, filtering, leaving reviews, and favorite products.
4. The ability for buyers to add products to cart, checkout, and view transaction orders.
5. The ability for sellers to view, accept, and cancel transaction orders.

## Documentation

This application uses Flask for its back-end systems, MySQL for its database, and React for its front-end.
